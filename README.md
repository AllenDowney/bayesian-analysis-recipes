# bayesian-analysis-recipes

## introduction

I've recently been inspired by how flexible and powerful Bayesian statistical analysis can be. Yet, as with many things, flexibility often means a tradeoff with ease-of-use. I think having a cookbook of code that can be used in a number of settings can be extremely helpful for bringing Bayesian methods to a more general setting!

## goals

My goal here is to have one notebook per model. In each notebook, you should end up finding:

- The kind of problem that is being tackled here.
- A description of how the data should be structured.
- An example data table.
- PyMC3 code for the model; in some notebooks, there may be two versions of the same model.
- Examples on how to report findings from the MCMC-sampled posterior.

It is my hope that you'll find these recipes useful!
